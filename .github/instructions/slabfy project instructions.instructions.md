# SlabFy - Intelligent Sports Card Collection Platform

## Overview

## Always follow slabfyrules.md


SlabFy is a cutting-edge sports card and collectible management platform that combines intelligent data caching, global market intelligence, and comprehensive collection tracking. The application features PSA slab scanning, real-time pricing data, and advanced AI-powered sales filtering to help collectors manage their portfolios effectively.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript and Vite for fast development
- **UI Framework**: ShadCN components with Tailwind CSS for consistent design
- **State Management**: TanStack React Query for server state and caching
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth integration with protected routes

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js API server
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations
- **Authentication**: Supabase for user management and JWT token validation
- **API Integration**: Countdown API for eBay marketplace data
- **Edge Functions**: Supabase Edge Functions for PSA API integration and AI processing

### Database Design
The application uses a sophisticated multi-table architecture optimized for data preservation and intelligent caching:

- **Global Assets**: Shared card metadata across all users to prevent data loss
- **User Assets**: Personal collection data with soft delete functionality
- **Sales History**: Comprehensive eBay pricing data with deduplication
- **PSA Cert Cache**: Permanent storage of PSA certificate metadata

## Key Components

### Intelligent Caching System
The platform implements a unique caching strategy that minimizes API calls while preserving data integrity:

- **First-time API calls only**: New assets trigger single API calls that store data permanently
- **Global data persistence**: PSA certificate data and sales history preserved even when users delete assets
- **Liquidity-based refresh schedules**: Smart refresh intervals based on market activity (fire: daily, hot/warm: weekly, cool: bi-weekly, cold: monthly)
- **Zero redundant calls**: Frontend returns cached data without triggering API requests

### PSA Integration System
Comprehensive PSA slab scanning and metadata management:

- **Certificate Lookup**: Supabase Edge Function integration with PSA API
- **Image Handling**: Front and back slab images with high-resolution support
- **Population Data**: Complete population report integration
- **Field Mapping**: Robust data normalization between PSA API and internal schema

### AI-Powered Sales Filtering
Advanced machine learning integration for accurate market data:

- **GROQ AI Integration**: Intelligent filtering of eBay sales data using Llama 3.1 model
- **Batch Processing**: 5 listings per API call with 70% confidence threshold
- **Fallback Strategy**: Returns unfiltered results if AI is unavailable
- **Cost Optimization**: 6,000 tokens/minute rate limit management

## Data Flow

### Asset Creation Flow
1. User scans PSA slab or enters certificate number
2. System checks PSA cert cache for existing data
3. If cache miss, calls PSA API via Supabase Edge Function
4. Creates or links to global asset record
5. Establishes user-asset relationship with personal data
6. Schedules liquidity-based refresh for pricing data

### Sales Data Pipeline
1. Global asset creation triggers initial pricing fetch
2. Countdown API provides eBay sold listings data
3. AI filtering removes irrelevant or lot-based sales
4. Deduplication prevents duplicate sales records
5. Liquidity rating determines future refresh schedule
6. Cached data serves all subsequent requests

### Authentication Flow
1. Supabase handles user registration and login
2. JWT tokens provided for API authentication
3. Development mode uses simplified auth for testing
4. Protected routes validate authentication status
5. User preferences and onboarding status tracked

## External Dependencies

### Third-Party APIs
- **PSA API**: Certificate metadata and population data
- **Countdown API**: eBay marketplace sales data

### Key Libraries
- **Drizzle ORM**: Type-safe database operations
- **TanStack React Query**: Server state management
- **Zod**: Runtime type validation
- **ShadCN**: UI component library
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling

## Deployment Strategy

### Development Environment
