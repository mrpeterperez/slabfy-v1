# RLS Security Audit Report
**Date:** October 2, 2025  
**Project:** SlabFy (sgieoyeaosgbzzxnzpxa)  
**Auditor:** AI Security Review

## Executive Summary

Comprehensive audit of all Row Level Security (RLS) policies across 24 tables in the SlabFy database. **CRITICAL security gap identified** in `purchase_transactions` table allowing cross-user data access.

### Severity Breakdown
- ðŸ”´ **CRITICAL (1):** User data leakage vulnerability
- ðŸŸ¡ **MEDIUM (5):** Missing RLS on shared/global tables
- ðŸŸ¢ **LOW (1):** Inconsistent RLS state (no security impact)

---

## ðŸ”´ CRITICAL SECURITY GAPS

### 1. purchase_transactions - USER DATA EXPOSURE
**Severity:** CRITICAL  
**Impact:** Users can view ALL purchase transactions across entire platform  
**Status:** RLS DISABLED with user_id column present

**Current State:**
- RLS: `false` (disabled)
- Policies: 0
- Has user_id column: YES âœ…
- Contains sensitive data: Purchase prices, payment methods, seller info, notes

**Security Risk:**
```sql
-- ANY authenticated user can run this and see ALL purchases:
SELECT * FROM purchase_transactions;
-- Returns purchase history from ALL users in the system
```

**Required Fix:**
```sql
ALTER TABLE purchase_transactions ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

CREATE POLICY "Users can manage own purchase transactions"
ON purchase_transactions
FOR ALL
TO public
USING (current_setting('app.user_id', true) = user_id)
WITH CHECK (current_setting('app.user_id', true) = user_id);
```

**Impact if not fixed:**
- Users can see other users' purchase prices
- Users can see other users' seller information
- Users can see other users' payment methods
- Competitive intelligence leakage (what dealers are buying/paying)

---

## ðŸŸ¡ MEDIUM PRIORITY GAPS

### 2. Global Shared Data Tables - Missing RLS Protection

These tables contain shared data across all users (PSA cache, sales history, etc.). While they don't contain user-specific data, they should still have RLS enabled with public SELECT policies for consistency and security best practices.

#### Tables Affected:
1. **psa_cert_cache** - PSA certificate metadata cache
2. **sales_fetches** - Sales data refresh tracking
3. **sales_history** - eBay/marketplace sales records
4. **sales_records** - Legacy sales data

**Current State:**
- RLS: `false` (disabled)
- Policies: 0 for all except global_assets (has policy but RLS disabled)
- No user_id columns (shared data)

**Required Fix:**
```sql
-- Enable RLS and allow public read access
ALTER TABLE psa_cert_cache ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE sales_fetches ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE sales_history ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE sales_records ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Public read-only access policies
CREATE POLICY "Public read access to PSA cache"
ON psa_cert_cache FOR SELECT TO public USING (true);

CREATE POLICY "Public read access to sales fetches"
ON sales_fetches FOR SELECT TO public USING (true);

CREATE POLICY "Public read access to sales history"
ON sales_history FOR SELECT TO public USING (true);

CREATE POLICY "Public read access to sales records"
ON sales_records FOR SELECT TO public USING (true);
```

**Why This Matters:**
- Defense in depth - RLS should be enabled on all tables
- Prevents accidental data modification through SQL
- Future-proofs if we add user-specific features

---

## ðŸŸ¢ LOW PRIORITY ISSUES

### 3. card_shows - Inconsistent RLS State

**Current State:**
- RLS: `false` (disabled)
- Policies: "Public read access to card shows" (SELECT policy exists)
- No user_id column (global data)

**Issue:** Policy exists but RLS is disabled, making policy non-functional

**Fix:**
```sql
ALTER TABLE card_shows ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
-- Policy already exists, just need to enable RLS
```

---

## âœ… SECURE TABLES (No Action Needed)

The following tables are **properly secured** with RLS enabled and appropriate policies:

### User-Specific Tables (user_id filtering)
- âœ… **user_assets** - Users can only access own portfolio
- âœ… **buy_offers** - Users can only access own buying desk sessions
- âœ… **contacts** - Users can only access own contact list
- âœ… **sellers** - Users can only access own seller relationships
- âœ… **buyers** - Users can only access own buyer relationships
- âœ… **consignors** - Users can only access own consignor relationships
- âœ… **consignments** - Users can only access own consignments
- âœ… **collections** - Users can only access own collections
- âœ… **events** - Users can only access own events
- âœ… **sales_transactions** - Users can only access own sales
- âœ… **users** - Users can only view/update own profile

### Join-Based Protection Tables
- âœ… **buy_offer_assets** - Protected via buy_offers.user_id JOIN
- âœ… **buy_offer_evaluation_assets** - Protected via buy_offers.user_id JOIN
- âœ… **collection_assets** - Protected via collections.user_id JOIN
- âœ… **consignment_assets** - Protected via consignments.user_id JOIN
- âœ… **event_inventory** - Protected via events.user_id JOIN

### Special Cases
- âœ… **invite_codes** - Service role only (proper isolation)
- âœ… **global_assets** - Has SELECT policy (just needs RLS enabled like others)

---

## Migration Priority

### Immediate (Production Blocker)
1. âœ… Enable RLS on `purchase_transactions` with user_id policy

### Before Production Deploy
2. âœ… Enable RLS on global tables (psa_cert_cache, sales_fetches, sales_history, sales_records)
3. âœ… Enable RLS on card_shows (policy already exists)

### Post-Production Enhancement
4. Consider adding INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE policies to global tables if backend needs write access
5. Add monitoring for RLS policy violations

---

## Implementation Notes

### Testing Checklist
- [ ] Create test user A and user B
- [ ] User A creates purchase transaction
- [ ] User B attempts to query purchase_transactions
- [ ] Verify User B sees ONLY their own purchases (not User A's)
- [ ] Test all CRUD operations (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
- [ ] Verify global tables readable by all users
- [ ] Test backend service role access if needed

### Rollback Plan
If migration causes issues:
```sql
-- Disable RLS on affected table
ALTER TABLE purchase_transactions DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Drop policies if needed
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can manage own purchase transactions" ON purchase_transactions;
```

---

## Conclusion

**Overall Security Posture:** ðŸŸ¡ MEDIUM RISK

The SlabFy database has generally good RLS coverage with 17/24 tables properly secured. The **critical gap** in `purchase_transactions` must be fixed before production deployment to prevent user data leakage.

**Recommended Action:** Deploy the provided migration immediately to close all security gaps.

**Next Steps:**
1. Apply migration file: `migrations/fix_rls_security_gaps.sql`
2. Run security test suite
3. Monitor production logs for RLS violations
4. Schedule quarterly RLS audits

## Audit Methodology

### Tools Used
- Supabase MCP (Model Context Protocol)
- PostgreSQL system catalogs (pg_tables, pg_policies)
- Information schema queries

### Queries Executed
```sql
-- Check RLS status
SELECT tablename, rowsecurity FROM pg_tables WHERE schemaname = 'public';

-- Check existing policies
SELECT * FROM pg_policies WHERE schemaname = 'public';

-- Check table schemas
SELECT * FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name = 'purchase_transactions';
```

### Coverage
- âœ… All 24 tables in public schema reviewed
- âœ… All 19 existing RLS policies analyzed
- âœ… Column-level analysis for user_id presence
- âœ… Policy logic verification (USING vs WITH CHECK clauses)
