## Bundle Optimization Status
- [x] Autoprefixer enabled for CSS optimization
- [x] Workbox configured with 5MB file size limit  
- [x] Service worker optimized for large assets
- [x] Runtime caching strategies implemented
- [x] Build optimization script created

## Deployment Configuration
- [x] Port 5000 configured correctly (app serves on 5000)
- [x] Host binding set to 0.0.0.0 for external access
- [x] Express server handles both API and static files

## PWA Configuration
- [x] Maximum file size increased to 5MB
- [x] Large asset caching optimized
- [x] Static asset caching with expiration
- [x] API caching with network-first strategy

## Next Steps
1. Test build process: `npm run build`
2. Verify bundle sizes are under control
3. Test service worker functionality
4. Deploy to production environment

## Troubleshooting
If deployment still fails:
1. Check if any single file exceeds 5MB
2. Verify workbox configuration is applied
3. Monitor network requests during deployment
4. Check server logs for detailed error messages
