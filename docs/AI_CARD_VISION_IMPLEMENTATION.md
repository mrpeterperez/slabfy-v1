# AI Card Vision Scanner - Implementation Complete 🎯

## What We Built

A production-ready AI-powered card scanning system that:
- Captures **front and back** images of trading cards
- Uses **GPT-4 Vision** to analyze card details
- **Smart routing**: PSA slabs → instant cert lookup, others → field extraction
- **Background processing**: scan multiple cards while AI analyzes them
- **Queue management**: see processing status, retry failures, review results

---

## Smart Detection Flow

```
User scans card (front + back)
    ↓
AI analyzes both images
    ↓
    ├─→ PSA Slab Detected?
    │   ├─→ YES: Extract cert# → Auto-lookup PSA data + pricing
    │   └─→ NO: Extract all fields → Pre-fill manual form
    ↓
User reviews & adds to portfolio
```

## Components Built

### 1. **DualScanCamera** (`client/src/features/card-vision/components/dual-scan-camera/`)
- Full-screen camera interface
- Frame guide overlay (shows card placement)
- Progress indicator (Front → Back)
- Continuous scanning (scan multiple cards in a row)
- Auto-restarts camera after capture

**Key Features:**
- Uses `navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia()` for camera access
- Canvas-based photo capture
- Returns `QueuedCard` with both images
- Mobile-optimized (facingMode: 'environment' for back camera)

### 2. **ProcessingQueue** (`client/src/features/card-vision/components/processing-queue/`)
- Bottom sheet showing all cards being processed
- Real-time status updates (processing → success/failed)
- Card thumbnails + detected info
- Tap to retry (failed) or review (success)
- Summary stats (X processing, Y completed, Z failed)

**Key Features:**
- Shows confidence levels
- PSA badge for certified cards
- Handles retry logic for failed analyses
- Auto-removes cards after user acts on them

### 3. **Edge Function Updates** (`supabase/functions/analyze-card-image/`)
- **index.ts**: Accepts `frontImage` + optional `backImage`
- **cert-detector.ts**: PSA cert detection logic + dual-image prompts
- Smart routing based on card type

**Detection Logic:**
```typescript
// Check back image for PSA cert label
if (detectPSACert(backImage)) {
  return {
    isPSAFastPath: true,
    certNumber: "12345678",
    fields: { certNumber: "12345678" }
  }
}

// Otherwise, full field extraction
else {
  return {
    isPSAFastPath: false,
    fields: {
      playerName: "LeBron James",
      year: "2003",
      brand: "Topps Chrome",
      // ... all detected fields
    }
  }
}
```

## Integration Points

### AddAssetLauncher Updates
**File:** `client/src/features/add-asset/components/add-asset-modal/add-asset-launcher.tsx`

**New State:**
```typescript
const [dualScanOpen, setDualScanOpen] = useState(false);
const [queueOpen, setQueueOpen] = useState(false);
const [processingQueue, setProcessingQueue] = useState<QueuedCard[]>([]);
```

**Flow:**
1. User clicks "Take A Photo"
2. `DualScanCamera` opens (full-screen)
3. User scans front → back
4. Card added to `processingQueue` (status: processing)
5. `ProcessingQueue` sheet opens automatically
6. AI analyzes in background
7. Queue updates to `success` or `failed`
8. User taps card in queue:
   - **PSA**: Opens `AddAssetModalSimple` with cert#
   - **Others**: Opens `ManualAddAssetDialog` with pre-filled fields
   - **Failed**: Retries analysis

---

## API Integration

### analyzeCardImages Function
**File:** `client/src/features/card-vision/services/card-vision.ts`

```typescript
export async function analyzeCardImages(
  frontImage: string,
  backImage?: string
): Promise<CardAnalysisResult>
```

**What it does:**
- Compresses images to <1MB
- Sends to Supabase Edge Function
- Parses GPT-4 Vision response
- Returns structured data + confidence score

**Response Structure:**
```typescript
{
  cardType: 'psa' | 'bgs' | 'sgc' | 'cgc' | 'raw' | 'tcg',
  confidence: 0.95,
  isPSAFastPath?: true,
  certNumber?: '12345678',
  fields: {
    playerName: 'LeBron James',
    year: '2003',
    brand: 'Topps Chrome',
    // ... more fields
  },
  frontAnalysis: 'Detected player photo...',
  backAnalysis: 'Found PSA cert label...'
}
```

## User Experience

### Happy Path (PSA Slab)
1. User clicks "Take A Photo"
2. Camera opens → "Position front of card"
3. User taps shutter → Toast: "Front captured!"
4. Camera switches → "Position back of card"
5. User taps shutter → Card added to queue
6. Queue sheet opens → "Processing..."
7. ~3 seconds later → "PSA #12345678" badge appears
8. User taps card → AddAssetModalSimple opens
9. PSA data auto-fetched + pricing loaded
10. User reviews → "Add to Portfolio"

### Happy Path (Raw Card)
1. Same scan flow (front + back)
2. Queue processes → "Ready to review"
3. User taps card → ManualAddAssetDialog opens
4. Form pre-filled: Player, Year, Brand, etc.
5. User reviews/edits → Pricing engine runs
6. "Add to Portfolio"

### Error Handling
- **Camera access denied**: Shows error message + "Try Again" button
- **Analysis failed**: Card marked as failed in queue with error message
- **Low confidence**: Shows warning toast, still pre-fills form
- **Retry**: Tap failed card → re-processes with same images

## TypeScript Types

### QueuedCard
```typescript
interface QueuedCard {
  id: string;
  frontImage: string;
  backImage?: string;
  thumbnail: string;
  status: 'processing' | 'success' | 'failed';
  result?: CardAnalysisResult;
  error?: string;
  timestamp: number;
}
```

### CardAnalysisResult
```typescript
interface CardAnalysisResult {
  cardType: CardType;
  confidence: number;
  isPSAFastPath?: boolean;
  certNumber?: string;
  fields: AnalyzedCardFields;
  frontAnalysis?: string;
  backAnalysis?: string;
  reasoning?: string;

## Technical Notes

### Image Compression
- Target: <1MB per image
- Quality: 0.9 JPEG
- Max dimension: 1920px
- Handled by `compressImage()` in card-vision service

### Camera Settings
- `facingMode: 'environment'` → Back camera on mobile
- `width: { ideal: 1920 }` → Good balance of quality/size
- `height: { ideal: 1080 }` → 16:9 aspect ratio

### OpenAI API
- Model: `gpt-4o` (latest vision model)
- Max tokens: 1000 (enough for structured response)
- Temperature: 0.3 (deterministic, accurate)
- Response format: JSON (structured data)

### Security
- Images sent as base64 via Supabase Edge Function
- No images stored on server (processed + discarded)
- CORS handled by Edge Function
- API key stored as Supabase secret

---

## Cost Estimation

### OpenAI API Costs (GPT-4 Vision)
- ~$0.01 per dual-image analysis
- 100 scans/day = ~$1/day = ~$30/month
- 1,000 scans/day = ~$10/day = ~$300/month

### Supabase Edge Functions
- Free tier: 500K invocations/month
- Beyond free tier: $2 per 1M invocations
- Should stay in free tier for most use cases

---

## Success Metrics

### Accuracy
- **Target**: >90% field extraction accuracy
- **PSA Detection**: >95% cert detection rate
- **Confidence**: >85% high-confidence results (>0.9)

### Performance
- **Analysis Time**: <5 seconds per card
- **Queue Throughput**: Handle 10+ cards in queue
- **Error Rate**: <5% failed analyses

### User Experience
- **Continuous Scanning**: Scan 5+ cards without closing camera
- **Queue Management**: Clear status for all cards
- **Retry Rate**: <10% of scans need retry

---

## Troubleshooting

### Camera not working
- Check browser permissions (Settings → Site Settings → Camera)
- Try HTTPS (camera requires secure context)
- Mobile: Check OS-level camera permissions

### Analysis fails every time
- Check Supabase Edge Function logs
- Verify OpenAI API key is set as secret
- Check image size (<1MB)
- Ensure edge function deployed

### Low confidence results
- Improve lighting when scanning
- Hold card steady, fill frame
- Ensure text is clearly visible
- Try rescanning with better angle

### Queue not updating
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify state management in AddAssetLauncher
- Check network tab for API responses
